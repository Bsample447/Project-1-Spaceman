<Spaceman + by Brandon>
Mankind has ever sought to explore the edges of the map, to reach new lands and meet new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

But....space travel isn't quick, even at light speed these things take a while, and to keep these brave explorers entertained on their long journey,
what else is there to do, but play word guessing games that humans have played for years...   but this time   ..in space.

Next Steps / IceBox features

1. Create a working list of arrays the player can choose to determine word choice, e.g foods, car brands or types, or cities
and have that be the words to guess.

2. Load game-over in chunks as the player loses so that it better represents spaceman game as played in real life.
